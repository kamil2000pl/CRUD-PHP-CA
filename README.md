# PHP CA2 CRUD Application
### By Kamil Jozefowicz
This is my CA2 submission for Server-Side Development
## How to setup
* Install and run XAMPP
* Import the keyboard_shop.sql file in PHP MyAdmin
* Move the PHP files in to your htdocs folder so Apache can process the PHP code
* Configure the database.php file to connect to your SQL database, if you use a MAC, you will need to change the password to 'root'
